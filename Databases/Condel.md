#  Condel

Condel is a meta-pathogenicity predictor that combines the outputs of various individual pathogenicity predictors (e.g. SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationAssessor) into a single consensus score and a prediction of neutral or deleterious. It can be used through the [Condel web server](https://bbglab.irbbarcelona.org/fannsdb/), or users can download the full database of pre-existing predictions from the same site.

Condel was last updated in 2014, and no new updates are planned for the future. However, it remains a popular choice for _in silico_ predictions of pathogenicity.
